package sorting

// Entropy-optimal sorting.
// Arrays with large numbers of duplicate sort keys arise frequently in applications.
// In such applications, there is potential to reduce the time of the sort from
// linearithmic to linear.

// One straightforward idea is to partition the array into three parts, one each
// for items with keys smaller than, equal to, and larger than the partitioning
// item's key. Accomplishing this partitioning was a classical programming exercise
// popularized by E.W.Dijkstra as the Dutch National Flag problem, because it is
// like sorting an array with three possible key values, which might correspond to
// the three colors on the flag.

// Dijkstra's solution is based on a single left-to-right pass through the array
// that maintains a pointer lt such that a[lo..lt-1] is less than v, a pointer gt
// such that a[gt+1..hi] is greater than v, and a pointer i such that a[lt..i-1]
// are equal to v, and a[i..gt] are not yet examined.

	quicksort3way(x, 0, x.Len()-1)

	quicksort3way(x, lo, lt-1)
	quicksort3way(x, gt+1, hi)
}

// Starting with i equal to lo+1 we process a[i] using the 3-way compare to handle
// the three possible cases:
// a[i] less than v: exchange a[lt] with a[i] and increment both lt and i
// a[i] greater than v: exchange a[i] with a[gt] and decrement gt
// a[i] equal to v: increment i
