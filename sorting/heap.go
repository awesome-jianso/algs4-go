// Heapsort.
// We can use any priority queue to develop a sorting method. We insert all
// the keys to be sorted into a minimum-oriented priority queue, then repeatedly
// use remove the minimum to remove them all in order. When using a heap for
// the priority queue, we obtain heapsort.

// Focusing on the task of sorting, we abandon the notion of hiding the heap
// representation of the priority queue and use swim() and sink() directly.
// Doing so allows us to sort an array without needing any extra space, by
// maintaining the heap within the array to be sorted. Heapsort breaks into two
// phases: heap construction, where we reorganzie the original array into a
// heap, and the sortdown, where we pull the items out of the heap in
// decreasing order to build the sorted result.
//
// Heap construction. We can accomplish this task in time proportional to NlgN,
// by proceeding from left to right through the array, using swim() to ensure
// that the entries to the left of the scanning pointer make up a heap-ordered
// complete tree, like successive priority queue insertions. A clever method that
// is much more efficient is to proceed from right to left, using sink() to make
// subheaps as we go. Every position in the array is the root of a small subheap;
// sink() works on such subheaps, as well. If the two children of a node are
// heaps, then calling sink() on that node makes the subtree rooted there a heap.
//
// Sortdown. Most of the work during heapsort is done during the second phase,
// where we remove the largest remaining items from the heap and put it into the
// array position vacated as the heap shrinks.
